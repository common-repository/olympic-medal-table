Displays the top ten countries and their medal totals from the Beijing Olympics

== Description ==

This widget will automatically update with the latest medal totals for the top 10 countries at the Beijing Olympic Games.

Display in your sidebar using <?php ?> or as a widget.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin into your /wp-content/plugins/ directory keeping the directory structure intact. This should create a folder called minitable. Enable the plugin from the plugins menu.

The plugin will create a widget, or you can call it directly from your theme by putting <?php olympics_showtheme(); ?> in your theme.

cURL or fsockopen must be enabled on your server for the plugin to work - this is almost always the case.
